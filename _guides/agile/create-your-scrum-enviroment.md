### Get Internal Support

Not only should the scrum teams be prepared for the inevitable cultural shift, but the organization as a whole needs to understand the product team’s behaviour so that they can interact and communicate effectively. For example, as the scrum team responds to demands from the ministry service or program they may need to rapidly scale on a temporary basis by interacting with government’s vendor partners. They will need to do this quickly and often without being able to reference defined requirements. Therefore, product teams need to collaborate closely with their colleagues in finance to ensure an appropriate level of service and comfort.

_Tips and tricks can be found in the Agile Wiki. Identifying all the key stakeholders and involving them in the transformation to agile is the responsibility of the product team._

Get support from your:

* **Assistant Deputy Minister**: Experience has proven that to transform your software development processes you need to create an organizational wide vision/mission and goals. To do this you will need the support of your senior executive team.
* **Executive Director**: You will be unintentionally challenging the status-quo within your organization and you need to get the support of management. They will need to build or modify their existing processes and ways of working to accommodate for the scrum processes. PSA/OCIO change team?
* **Product Team**: Transforming or transitioning to an agile scrum mindset takes time and effort. Your team needs to be included in the dialogue when creating the vision, values and actions necessary to support your new working paradyme. One of the best methods for ensuring this happens is to employ and organizational design strategy. An explanation of how organizational design works can be found at the [OD Network](http://www.bcodn.org/).

### Checklist:

* Get your ADM on board.
* Get an executive sponsor at the Executive Director level.
* Develop a vision for your agile transformation i.e. what is the value proposition for your organization? (Refer to the Business Model Canvas for ideas).
* Facilitate a dedicated self-organizing team. That is, ensure that your team will have access to a system such as GitHub, ZenHub, JIRA or Trello so that traceability and transparency can occur.
* Engage your finance team to gain support for flexible team scaling on a time and materials basis.
* Work with your organization's management teams and share your vision and goals.
* Choose a methodology i.e. Scrum, Kanban.
* Determine one metric that you’re going to track i.e. velocity
* Foster an environment that accepts user-centric or human-centered design. See the [Luma institute](https://www.luma-institute.com/) or [Ideo.org](https://www.ideo.org/) for examples of this.

### Identify Stakeholders in Your Organization

As in any situation where you are changing a broad direction or goals, it is important to create a stakeholder map. Our experience is that there are two stakeholder groups that need particular attention, your finance director and your management team.

### Finance Stakeholders

* You will need to scale your product team using government’s private sector partners quickly and there will be no fixed requirements. To do this you will need the understanding, support and help from your finance team.

### Management Team Stakeholders

* Working in scrum teams is different from other common project management methods. The scrum team is dedicated and receives its work via a specific planning process.
* The members of the scrum team are accountable to one person for the delivery of the sprint artifacts and traditional line management takes a back seat to the scrum process. This is a difficult mindshift for line managers and it is essential that an organizational management process be designed to accommodate inclusion, dialogue and collaboration.
