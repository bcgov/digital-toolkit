Agile software development (also referred to as Mode 2) focuses on active user involvement, incremental releases, testing early and often, and delivering functional pieces of the application as soon as they're ready. The goal of agile development is to build upon small, client-approved parts as the project progresses, as opposed to delivering one large application at the end of the project. The result of using agile, versus other more traditional approaches (waterfall for example, referred to as Mode 1,) is that you get the right application, not the one you thought you wanted 18 months ago.

We did not invent this approach. Industries and governments around the globe have adopted agile principles with great success. Preparing to use agile scrum in a government environment requires dedication, time and flexibility.
