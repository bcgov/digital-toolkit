### Figure Out Why You Want To Become Agile

Agile is a mindset backed by methodologies that leaves a trail of techniques. For our purposes, any software method is considered agile if it follows the [manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), which states:

* Individual and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

And while there is value on the items to the right, the items on the left are valued more.

Within that, the many methodologies that sit under the agile umbrella typically feature the following characteristics:

* Incremental product development
* Iterative delivery
* Fast feedback loops
* Team empowerment

> The case for change for agile continues to develop and expand as its adoption grows. The annual "State of Agile Development" survey, based on more than 4,000 respondents, provides some highlights on the benefits of agile. For four years running, the top three benefits of agile development remain:

* Ability to manage changing priorties (87%)
* Team productivity (84%)
* Project visibility (82%)

### Align to Agile Principles

Setting up a scrum team is half the equation as operating in an agile fashion requires an understanding of the underpinning principles and values that brings the community together. Essentially, [the 12 agile principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) allude to values such as adaptation, cooperation and adjustment. To achieve this, individuals within your product team must be:

* Open to the concept of transparency on a number of levels as described in the Government’s Open By Default \[TBD\] initiative
* Accepting of the fact that their project artifacts (including code) and methodologies will be open to inspection by people within and outside of their organization

These are critical behaviours that will improve the understanding of business needs as well as the overall quality of the products produced. Preparing and working to instill these values into the daily functions of the product team is critical. Training resources and links can be found in the Agile Wiki \[TBD\].

### Align Your Team with Scrum

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and development practices so that you can improve. The scrum framework consists of scrum teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules.

### Complete a Value Proposition Canvas

A value proposition canvas (for example, [Strategyzer](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/vpc)) enables you to describe and design an overview of what a customer needs and why. It is perfect, for example, as part of a business model review to document or present pains and gains of specific products for specific customer segments. As such, it helps to create a very good basis for product design.
