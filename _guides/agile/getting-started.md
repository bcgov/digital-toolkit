The B.C. tech sector has embraced the value-driven approach of agile development as this framework has proven to be an effective way of managing risk in information technology (IT) based projects. Agile is a mindset that focuses on the delivery of business value and quality to the client in an incremental and iterative manner that provides the most value in the given time.

As such, the development and delivery of software has evolved over the past decade to include processes that permit a constant stream of new features to be delivered daily while maintaining functionality, stability and usability standards. In addition, new ways of approaching the creation of enterprise solutions have emerged where design drives architecture and functional code is written based on preconceived tests (i.e. test-driven development).

With this in mind, we have identified 20 key steps that, if followed together, will help the BC government build more effective products.
