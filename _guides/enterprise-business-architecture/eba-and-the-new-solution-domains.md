title: EBA & the New Solution Domains
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture

The EBA does not exist in a vacuum; rather, it is part of an ecosystem contributing to a more collaborative approach to designing and building services. A set of new solution domains have been identified that will move government forward more rapidly and efficiently on its transformation journey. Work is underway across all domains in an effort to introduce a whole of government approach to providing solutions whereby service owners leverage a series of corporate guides to tackle their immediate business issues. These guides will provide a set of repeatable building actions that reduce the effort, time, and money required to build or enhance services. The EBA is one of these guides. The following diagram outlines the new domains for business solution design:
