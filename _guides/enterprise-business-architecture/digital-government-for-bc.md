The purpose of each section in the blueprint is outlined here:

**Aligning to Government Priorities** This section establishes the strategic drivers that influence and inform the rest of the Blueprint. The Province of British Columbia Strategic Plan 2015/16 – 2018/19 (layer 1) and Where Ideas Work (layer 2) set the overarching direction to which digital transformation must align. The Sector Strategies layer represents the business strategies and objectives specific to each sector that must be facilitated by lower levels in the diagram

**Business Context** This section shows high-level business capabilities critical to supporting Government priorities; these are things that government does, that must be facilitated by people, process, and technology. Some capabilities are “common” across government sectors. For example, an ability “to accept a registration application” is something that happens in many places in government, and best practise would leverage common aspects of the capability where it is used. For comparison, (at a more granular level,) the ability “to find a bed for vulnerable youth” is also something government does, though in a much more focused context. Both of these examples of business capability are facilitated, and fully-supported in a digital government context, by the lower sections of the framework.

**Digital Enablement** The section fuses the traditional domains from enterprise architecture (TOGAF) and the OCIO technology enablers (5 pillars) with the future state service needs of our citizens. The intersection of an EA domain and a pillar informs how "digital" is being addressed.

**Enablers** The final section of the Blueprint identifies common components and services that should be consistently consumed across government. These “corporate enablers” are cross-government business enablers that provide value in many ways. The more these common components are used to deliver service, the more consistent is customer experience and the more predictable are outcomes. There are several “classifications” of enabler, some very granular, and others at more of a “service” level
