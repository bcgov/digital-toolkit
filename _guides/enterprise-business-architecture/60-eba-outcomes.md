The Blueprint seeks to address User Stories like the following:

**INCREASE UTILIZATION OF CORPORATE ENABLERS** As a service owner, I want to understand the capabilities of government's corporate enablers and how they support my initiative, so that I can use them to reduce the cost of my solution, expedite it's time to delivery, and bring consistency to my audience.

**INCREASE MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES** As a service owner, I want the Blueprint and EBA Approach to provide me with a benefits realization framework for measuring and monitoring the performance of my service against its defined outcomes, so that I can continually evaluate its operations, identify opportunities to realign services / products based on changing stakeholder needs, and provide empirical feedback to my executive on successes and challenges.

**INCREASED ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SERVICE DECISIONS MADE AND DIGITAL GOVERNMENT STRATEGY** As a service owner, I want the Blueprint to provide clear direction on the design of digital services that align with government strategy, so that I know my initiative aligns with government priorities while the work I do reduces technical diversity and complexity.

**INCREASE AWARENESS OF CITIZENS** As a service owner, I want the Blueprint to provide insight into the relationship between citizen, government, and complexity and the impact to all three on the decisions I make, so that when I build a service the citizen receives an exemplary, consistent experience, government achieves maximum value for its investment, and the service deployed meets user needs consistent with the goals of digital government.

**INCREASE EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION MAKING ACROSS ALL PHASES OF AN INITIATIVE** As a service owner, I want empirical evidence to defend every service investment decision so I am certain the optimal investment portfolio serves citizens.
