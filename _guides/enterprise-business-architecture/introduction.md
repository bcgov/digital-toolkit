In 2015-16, The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer to produce an Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) framework that reflected an agreed upon set of business and technology decisions that government had collectively made to help direct service transformation. The Enterprise Business Architecture Blueprint for the Government of British Columbia and the EBA Alignment Framework Diagram are a clear set of strategic, business, and technical guidelines that both service owners and technologists in government should use when making decisions about the creation of new services.

The EBA Approach is about enterprise alignment and uses the Alignment Framework as an assessment tool to measure an initiative against the enterprise strategic, business, and technology decisions of government. A workshop has been developed to walk service owners through the alignment process from which they will receive feedback and guidance to strengthen their enterprise alignment.

> The Digital Government Blueprint will play a critical role in the success of the province’s digital transformation. It is key that our partners use the Blueprint and find value in the EBA pproach. To accomplish this, we will be working with our ministry partners to test our assumptions and collect real-time intelligence on the effectiveness of the Blueprint in support of their digital journey. It is their feedback and endorsement that will be the true measure of success for the EBA Approach.

The Alignment Framework and EBA Approach will provide benefits to government by:

* Highlighting a clear set of strategic, business, and technical decisions that ensure alignment between the government’s strategic objectives, technology environment, and the services created
* Assisting in the prioritization of initiatives from across government that best position BC as a leader in digital government
* Building consistency into the citizen and employee experience by leveraging existing services and corporate enablers
* Maximizing the investments made in digital services through the identification of common business processes and shared technology needs across government
