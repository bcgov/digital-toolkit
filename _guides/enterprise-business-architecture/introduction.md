In 2015-16, The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) to produce a framework that lays a foundation for digital government.

Feedback on previous versions has shaped the evolution of this work, as has a deeper understanding of government goals, and updated enterprise strategy documents. (The entire collection of current ministry service plans can be found via a Google search for "BC gov ministry service plans".) This iteration of EBA focusses on:

Delivering a more easily-consumable framework
Identifying enablers for digital government
Communicating an EBA engagement approach that strengthens alignment to strategic goals, providing guidance for success, and
Gathering feedback on the framework and the engagement approach.
“The Blueprint,” as it is known, and the EBA Engagement Approach will provide benefits to government by:

Guiding the evolution of digital enablers
Facilitating collaboration across service areas
Assisting in the prioritization of service initiatives, and
Identifying opportunities to leverage corporate enablers.
