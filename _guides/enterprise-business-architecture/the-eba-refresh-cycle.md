title: The EBA Refresh Cycle
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

Note: The processes described below are currently under review. By offering this Enterprise Architecture guidance in the public domain, we are opening it to feedback and contribution from across government and beyond. Our thought is that "approval" for an "Enterprise Architecture," or "Enterprise Business Architecture," program is secured, and then the documentation that describes the process of "enterprise architecture" becomes less that, and more pointers to good work and effective methodology that can be leveraged easily wherever it shows value. "Enterprise architecture" will continue to be practised, but what is found here are the outcomes, the levers, the re-usable stuff that makes digital easier and easier as it evolves. Much of government "digital" will live in Github - at the moment, it seems appropriate for this work to live in the same place.

The EBA must be a living document that reflects the rapid pace of change and innovation faced by government. This section outlines the bi-annual refresh cycle for the EBA and the groups responsible for endorsement throughout the process.

The decision was made to refresh the guide twice a year in order to:

- Capture the release of new strategies and executive directives that impact the content of the EBA,
- Summarize the current business and technology needs of service owners as revealed in business plans and IMIT Capital submissions, and
- Assess the impact of new technologies and common services on the way government will design and deliver services.

The refresh cycle will consist of two six-month cycles that more or less mirror each other. They will start with a review and research phase where the ASPB team will spend time meeting with stakeholders to collect feedback and reviewing the latest direction of government. With the first draft of the new changes, the ASPB team will take the EBA to the Service Strategic Working Group for a second round of feedback and possibly more edits-this process will be iterative as there may be several engagements along the way. The goal is to gain endorsement from the working group to bring the updated EBA to the Service Delivery Board. The next step then is to have the Service Delivery Board review the EBA. Again, this process will be iterative with time given for several meetings to take place prior to the board’s endorsement and release of the new version. The lists of tasks associated with the lifecycle are as follows:

### Phase & Tasks:

#### EBA Research and Document Update

- Meet with stakeholders to assess the value of EBA and identify gaps for the new release
- Review current government strategy documents, service and business plans
- Review successful IMIT Capital Submissions
- Review technology trends and disrupters
- Update document and framework

#### Review and Endorsement Strategic Working Group

- Review updates with individual SWG members
- Bring changes to SWG meeting(s)
- Iterate review with SWG members
- Gain endorsement to take new version to SDB

#### Review and Endorsement Service Delivery Board

- Review updates with individual SDB members
- Bring changes to SDB meeting(s)
- Iterate review with SDB members
- Gain endorsement to release new version
