title: The Alignment Workshop
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

The Alignment Process consists of two engagements. First is the Alignment workshop where architects from the OICO work with a small team related to an initiative and walk through the Alignment Guide which is a series of questions to help both parties understand where current alignment is strong and adjustments can be made for greater success. It is designed to be quick, light-weight, and produce immediate feedback for the stakeholder. The characteristics of the Alignment Workshop are:

- **_Time commitment:_** two hours
- **_Team commitment:_** two or three members of the initiative
- **_Artifact:_** The Alignment Guide
- **_Stakeholder value:_** Understanding of enterprise alignment and objectives; higher awareness of enablers
