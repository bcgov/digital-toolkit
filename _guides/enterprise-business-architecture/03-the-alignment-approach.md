title: The Alignment Approach
guide: Enterprise Business Architecture
---

From stakeholder feedback received about prior versions of this work, more guidance was required on the process of showing alignment. The process is explained here:

**Digital Government Alignment Framework** The EBA Approach uses the Digital Government Blueprint as a framework to measure alignment against enterprise strategy. Aligning an initiative to the overarching direction of government is a critical first step. This alignment helps ensure that services provided by government support the objectives of digital government.

**The Alignment Process** The Alignment Process validates that what we do in government fully supports government priorities. "Alignment" ensures strategic benefit, and "proper success" – success that is reusable, whether the effort is process design, business architecture, determining a component feature set, exploring user experience, or policy change. Strong alignment means that business areas, regardless of ministry, work toward congruent goals and outcomes, design and manage their services in a consistent, measureable, and repeatable way, and make technology investments that solve their immediate business problem, yet provide enterprise-wide benefit, where possible. The high-level focus of alignment is embodied by questions like:

1.  What specific Goals and Priorities does this initiative support?
1.  How do the specific outcomes for this project support sector objectives?
1.  How does the roadmap for this service impact resourcing? How will today's business process change, and how is it expected to evolve with the service? 1. What about this service helps us be more competitive?
1.  _The OCIO strategy, itself, is a product of alignment, and is intended to help government business areas make sound, strategic, technology decisions._ 1. What parts of the Digital Enablement grid are most relevant to this effort?
1.  Are there opportunities to consume corporate enablers?
1.  Is there opportunity for new corporate enablers?
1.  What other services or business areas can be engaged to help?
