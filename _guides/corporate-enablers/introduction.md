A significant focus of the Enterprise Business Architecture effort is to uncover good work across the enterprise and encourage its re-use. That "good work" can take many forms, and may look like these:

* the efficient way a business process is handled
* the outstanding design of a citizen service
* the method by which that service was designed
* building an interactive map into an application
* the way a team collaborates
* effective practices or policy
* making data available to the enterprise
* publishing open data
* a new "official cities of BC" list that can be used by all business systems
* the use of BCeID
* a good way to build an iOS app
* an interface to an application that can be used by many other applications
* the way that we "personalize" for BC citizens
* leveraging great government consulting services that help us work effectively
* good guidance on the use of cloud computing

This list suggests many kinds of "good work" that can - and should - be shared, across government. Referring to these as "corporate enablers" at this time, they will provide consistency in approach, consistency in building, operating, and delivering services digitally. With a [common set of resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/practices/07-use-common-solutions/) - consulting, procedural, strategic, technical, workshop - and a set of infrastructure that can be taken for granted, government will reduce risk, reduce cost, and increase consistency, while meeting the expectations of "digital" for citizens of British Columbia.

This first iteration, an initial collection, of corporate enablers, has been gathered into the following categories, and will change:

* Citizen & Business - This collection of enablers with a distinct "outward focus" includes Contact Centre, FrontCounter BC, BC Stats, BC Online, and BC Registries.
* Cloud & Hosting - services and platforms and software - all of these services: Data Centre Co-location, Managed Hosting, and CloudBC.
* Communication & Collaboration - This set enables people to work together on common objectives, and includes Network BC, Collaboration Software, Unified Device Management, and Device Services.
* Data & Information - being more open while ensuring privacy and security; more access to the right information.  This category includes GeoBC, DataBC, the Data Innovation Program, and BC Stats.
* Financial - including Corporate Financial System (CFS), and PayBC.  These are programs, procedures, workflows, services, and technical interfaces that facilitate financial-related interactions.
* Human Resources - a significant focus of "Where Ideas Work", enablers in this category include Recruitment Management System, Corporate Human Resources Information & Payroll System (CHIPS), The Learning Centre, and Time Leave and Management (TLAM.)
* Identity - who am I and what can I do?  This includes both BC Services Card and BCeID Authentication Services


These categories will change as the concept of corporate enablers evolves. Each is described in more detail through the links on the left.
