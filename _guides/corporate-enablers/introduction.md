A significant focus of the Enterprise Business Architecture effort is to uncover good work across the enterprise and encourage its re-use. That "good work" can take many forms, and may look like these:

* the efficient way a business process is handled
* the outstanding design of a citizen service
* the method by which that service was designed
* the way a team collaborates
* effective practises or policy
* a new "official cities of BC" list that can be used by all business systems
* the use of BCeID
* a good way to build an iOS app
* an interface to an application that can be used by many other applications
* the way that we "personalize" for BC citizens
* leveraging great government consulting services that help us work effectively
* good guidance on the use of cloud computing

This list suggests many kinds of "good work" that can - and should - be shared, across government. Referring to these as "corporate enablers" at this time, they will provide consistency in approach, consistency in building, operating, and delivering services digitally. With a common set of resources - consulting, procedural, strategic, technical, workshop, - and a set of infrastructure that can be taken for granted, government will reduce risk, reduce cost, and increase consistency, while meeting the expectations of "digital" for citizens of British Columbia.

This first iteration, an initial collection, of corporate enablers, has been gathered into the following categories, and will change:

* Financial - programs, procedures, workflows, services, and technical interfaces that facilitate financial-related interactions
* Identity - who am I and what can I do?
* Cloud & Hosting - services and platforms and software
* Data & Information - being more open while ensuring privacy and security; more access to the right information
* Communication & Collaboration - enabling people to work together on a common objective
* Citizen & Business - a collection of enablers with a distinct "outward focus"
* Device & Productivity - the right tools for the job
* Human Resources - a significant focus of "Where Ideas Work"
* Digital Implementation - the tools and technical bits that will specifically target MyGov and digital delivery to citizens

These categories will change as the concept of corporate enablers evolves. Each is described in more detail in the following pages.
