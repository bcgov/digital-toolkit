title: Leverage flexible deployment
---

If we design, build and test in ways that aim to get services to market quickly, then it doesn’t make sense to spend months going through legacy hurdles to get the services up an running on systems that don't quickly adapt to changing needs. Building services on a flexible infrastructure, like cloud computing, will enable Ministries to quickly and easily purchase computing resources on demand, only pay for what they actually use, scale up or down depending on needs, and improve overall resiliency. To enable this approach to deployment, we need more lightweight procurement processes that allow us to achieve as close to industry best practices as our regulatory requirements permit. By doing so, we will open up opportunities to do business with new vendors, small businesses and innovative start-ups who work in modern, agile ways, but don’t have the capacity or resources for long RFP processes.
